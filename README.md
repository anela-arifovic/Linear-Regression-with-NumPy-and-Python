# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
Coursera: Machine learning without use of any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. 
The aim of this project is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, 
of the various learning algorithms, to have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.


Learning objectives:

Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch <br />
Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python <br />
Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib
